                        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React

                        APIs
                        as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of

                        React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                        JavaScript.
                        To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you
                        started
                        or can serve as a refresher course.

                        We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                        approachable
                        creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
                        like
                        so:
                        <blockquote>Hello, I am your cat!</blockquote> The React docs have a comprehensive
                        guide to JSX you can
                        refer
                        to
                        learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
                        declaring
                        a
                        name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        + props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                        render,
                        state
                        is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes
                        over
                        time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="text-input">Handling Text Input</h2>
                    <p>
                        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop
                        that
                        takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                        takes a
                        function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçïüçïüçï".
